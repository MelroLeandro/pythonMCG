PythonCG strives to provide the lowest-threshold way to learn Math for CG. Students command an interactive Python shell (similar to the IDLE development environment) and use Python functions to display 2D graphic objects on the screen. An illustrated help screen introduces the student to the basics of Python programming while demonstrating how to move the turtle.

Tested with Python 2.7 and wxPython 3.0.0.0. Currently tested only on Windows and Ubuntu.
